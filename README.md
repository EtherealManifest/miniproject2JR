The Second Project
This file appears to be missing pieces because it 
does not have the .csv file. this is due to 
github's file size limit. to download this file, go to
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickgendotti/mtg-all-cards
and select 'download'. put this file in the 
same folder as this program, and name it all_mtg_cards.csv. 
This program should then run correctly.

This program does some relatively simple graph
generations for a database of all of the Magic: The Gathering
Cards. It takes the graphs it creates and puts them in a 
folder called Charts, created at runtime if it doesn't already
exist.
